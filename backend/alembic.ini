# Alembic Configuration File
#
# Alembic is a database migration tool. Think of it as "version control for your database."
# When you change your database models (add a table, add a column, etc.), Alembic
# creates a migration file that records those changes. This lets you:
# - Apply changes to production databases safely
# - Roll back changes if something goes wrong
# - Keep track of database schema history
#
# This file tells Alembic where to find things and how to connect to the database.

[alembic]

script_location = alembic

# Template used for generating migration file names
# %(rev)s is the revision ID, %(slug)s is the message you provide
file_template = %%(year)d%%(month).2d%%(day).2d_%%(hour).2d%%(minute).2d_%%(rev)s_%%(slug)s

# Timezone for migration timestamps
timezone = UTC

# Truncate slug to this many characters
truncate_slug_length = 40

# (all changes succeed or all fail together)
